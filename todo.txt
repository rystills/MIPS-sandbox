issues:
-windows line endings are not handled properly
-spacebar, arrow keys, delete key do not fire multiple times when held down (other keys do)
-ctrl brings you to the beginning of a textfield, rather than to the beginning of the current line
-up and down arrow keys cannot be used to navigate between lines in a multi-line textfield
-maximized Windows performance and general Ubuntu performance are rather poor; profiling should be done to resolve this
-determine why windows ProggyClean size 19 is equal to Ubuntu ProggyClean size 13

feature ideas:
-store preferences (window dims, fullscreen?) in an external file
-threaded simulation with shared memory for outputting to the GUI without affecting performance
