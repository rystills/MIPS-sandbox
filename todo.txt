issues:
-spacebar, arrow keys, delete keys can fire continuously on Windows, but may not fire continuously on Ubuntu (untested - check and update me)
-windows line endings are not handled properly
-ctrl brings you to the beginning of a textfield, rather than to the beginning of the current line
-maximized Windows performance and general Ubuntu performance are rather poor; profiling should be done to resolve this
-determine why windows ProggyClean size 19 is equal to Ubuntu ProggyClean size 13

feature ideas:
-store preferences (window dims, fullscreen?) in an external file
-threaded simulation with shared memory for outputting to the GUI without affecting performance
-hotkeys
-copy/paste (see nuklear.h line 22794)
-undo/redo (see nuklear.h line 4160)
-select all (need to add NK_KEY_TEXT_SELECT_ALL to all 11 driver files in nuklear+)
-line numbers in code edit window
-make should create bin folder
