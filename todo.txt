issues:
-code edit scrollbar hides when inactive (should always be visible, as with the register window)
-windows driver only supports LCONTROL (not RCONTROL)
-scrollbar always scrolls register window

potential issues to check:
-determine why windows ProggyClean size 19 is equal to Ubuntu ProggyClean size 13
-maximized window on windows is a bit laggy, alt + tabbing and alt + f4 on Ubuntu are very laggy

desired features:
-toggle register edit modes (int, hex, ...)
-main menu button hover indicators
-horizontal scrollbar for code window
-copy/paste (see nuklear.h line 22794)
-undo/redo (see nuklear.h line 4160)
-enter newline should also tab to the current line indentation level
-line numbers in code edit window
-store preferences (window dims, fullscreen?) in an external file
-threaded simulation with shared memory for outputting to the GUI without affecting performance
-replace exitError calls with warning messages and continuation when possible
